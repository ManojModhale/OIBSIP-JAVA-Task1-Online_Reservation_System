In this repository, I have posted task-1 that I have completed during my internship at "Oasis Infobyte".  <br>
I have completed Internship 'Task-1', Which involves creating a "Online Reservation System", I've made Web based Application using SpringBoot. Where user can register and login with valid credentials <br>
then user can make reservations or view all reservation of him. He also can Cancel his particular reservation and logout..<br>
In this Project there are Jsp pages,Bean Classes, DAO Class, Service Interface, Controller. <br>
If you want to run this project then you have to run OnlineReservationSystemApplication.java file because this is SpringBoot Application.<br>
